               <p>Having interacted and stayed with a cousin who had to drop out from school due to early pregnancy, I believe that young girls who drop out from school due to early pregnancy need a second chance to better their lives .These girls go through so much to get little money to sustain themselves.</p>
                <p>Some go to the extent of selling their bodies for a coin. I believe that these girls once they attain education and get a self sustainable job they can better their lives.Therefore, having the skills on bakery, I thought of having a means to help them through the same.In this case, I will get to make the products and motivate them in doing sales and marketing of the products and depending on the amount of product one sells they get to earn money that will assist them in supporting themselves and their children.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, children in the urban slums are greatly suffering due to malnutrition.I thought of the best way to get children have nutrition in their diet is by making nutritious snacks for them.Children are mostly interested in colourful and sweet food.Most of parents in the urban slums feed their children on junk as they go school and having healthy snacks as an alternative I believe will be of great impact to their health.</p>
